# TrainSchedule

This project uses jQuery and moment.js to create a dynamic table that can be appended with new time information, and employs firebase to log and stay current on times and related calculations. This project is great for practicing firebase, as well as building code that appends html according to user inputs. Future revisions might include an option to remove trains, and a field for special messages, like delays.
